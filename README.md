# Arrival_Time_Dist_GUI
A program which produces 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional graphs for arrival time distributions, and allows calibration with incorporation with Amphitrite [1], so produce collision induced unfolding graphs. Takes .txt files and .a files, outputs graphs as .png and .svg (for tidying up). Can also be used to average up to 3 sets of data.

libs and imclasses from Amphitrite.
