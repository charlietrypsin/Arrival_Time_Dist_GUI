- Check to make sure they havent tried something genius like renaming a random file.
- Also this will give away that you are using pickles
*** DONE Stop xfill from changing the y axis limits
*** DONE Get rid of yticks with CCSds
*** DONE Change 'ATDs' tickbox to 'ATDs/CCSDs'

*** DONE Changing species and charge choices
- It should retick the massSpectra checkbox
- Simulataneously disabling the others
*** DONE Put width multipliers below sp and z choices
*** DONE Clean up the terminal output (stop printing BS)

+ This should also be done with IesGui
*** TODO Different axes for different files?!?!
- You are going to have to do some clever interpolation, its going to be gash

*** To Do Later
**** This [[file:~/Dropbox/workspaces/Amphitrite_2.0/gui/ContourGui/CtrPlotPanel.py::def%20plotCcsVsMzPeakTops%20self%20ax%20species%20colour%20b][function]] should be in Im.Im()
See [[file:~/Dropbox/workspaces/Amphitrite_2.0/gui/ContourGui/CtrPlotPanel.py::self%20settings%20imOb%20plotChargeStateContourPeaktops][here]] for example
** Calibration
*** BUGS
**** TODO Peak picking has stopped working
*** You want to be able to add additional calibrants
**** from csv or something
**** or even a web form
+ it could create a calibrant file, which you could then import into the program
*** Open from Atropos as well as independently
*** Update calibration function, separate wave velocity values for IM and transfer cells
** General
*** TODO Fix resizing plot display bug
- You could alter the function of the zoom out button so that it takes lims you provide
*** TODO Make sure you can track intensities of diff species in mass spectra
- i.e. same as peak height analysis of ATDs in IesGui
- Should probably be in the IesGui for that reason
*** TODO Combine blac1 and blac2 in Calibrant
*** TODO Add try catch for opening .a files (just check if file exists)
** 130828 last bugs before release
*** Apply Calibration Gui
**** TODO Hide panel before overwriting
**** TODO Remove default paths
**** TODO Coordinate file, error's out if there is an extra newline at the end
This is especially bad because thats how masslynx gives it...
**** TODO When you open a coord file, the radiobox should automatically change to 'Display td'
**** TODO Changing to 'Display CCS' shouldn't print out the coords for harpal anymore
**** TODO Fix the Plotting options listctrl
***** TODO Remove auto axis option
***** TODO Make it actually autoaxis when you click the update button
**** TODO Make the calculate button work
*** Atropos
**** Do anywhere
***** DONE Remove default paths
***** DONE After opening a new file, shit fucks up
if you press simulate the your ms module has no idea about the information in the table and so can't find the species name from the table in the species dictionary...
... text files don't overwrite the species dictionary and so work fine ...
***** DONE If you are on peak finding when you click update it should go back to this automatically
***** DONE make the default level for limit 1
***** TODO If peak IDs section is selected and nothing is filled in, nothing should happen, its been bugging out cos of that
**** wxGlade
***** DONE Change Display radiobox orientation so that they are listed vertically
***** DONE Maybe make the whole start size bigger
***** TODO If you can make the peak finding panel a bit bigger
*** Calibration Gui
**** Do anywhere
***** DONE Remove default paths
***** DONE Change start wave velocity to 350
***** DONE Get rid of yticks on the mass spectrum panel
***** DONE Hiding panel thing
***** TODO Sort out the autoaxis in Y dimension for PyK (others seem fine)
***** TODO PICK BUTTON HAS BROKEN (IT WORKED THIS MORNING) 130902
**** wxGlade
***** DONE Improve the names of the calibrants
***** DONE Get rid of the apply calibration button and make the save button bigger
***** DONE Fix name in top left (was moved for unhidden panel)
*** Contour Plot
**** DONE Remove default paths
**** DONE Can't open calibration files properly (windows only)
**** DONE There is some weird issue with the afit not working on the second file
I think the second file isn't initialised properly:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "ContourGui.py", line 360, in eventRadioboxPlotPanel
    self.plotPanel.refresh_plot()
  File "/home/ganesh/Dropbox/workspaces/Amphitrite_2.1/gui/ContourGui/CtrPlotPanel.py", line 311, in refresh_plot

    dataSlice.matrix -= dataSlices2[sp][z].matrix
KeyError: u'Dimer'


The problem happens if you follow the order of the gui:
file 1
cal
atropos
file 2

if you do atropos last it doesn't fix it
calibration last doesn't fix it

this doesn't work either:
file1 file2
cal atropos

or this:
file1 file2
atropos cal

or this
file1 atropos 
file2 cal

Can't work out how I made it work now

Something hasn't made it's dataSlices basically

*DONE*
In the end I hadn't called generateSpeciesSlices, I had only called getSpeciesSlices
**** TODO Maybe use different colours for each species range
**** TODO For peakTops use white with an alpha value as the centre (still need black ring round outside) (half done)
**** TODO Include ATD charge state plots (atropos without calibration)
**** TODO Make peak top identification work without calibration
**** Refresh plot after
***** DONE 'Show peak tops' 
***** DONE 'Auto Limits'
***** DONE 'Show Charge State Plot'
***** DONE choice box for 'Show Charge State Plot'
***** DONE choice scale
***** DONE choice background colour
**** wxGlade
***** DONE Add event for auto limits checkbox
*** Ies Gui
**** TODO Change the name of it
**** TODO Until atropos file is added you shouldn't be able to press process
Then after you add the click drag functionality you can get that to undo the greying out
**** TODO [windows] full screening the window mkes the right panel get enormous, should be fixed
**** TODO complaining about calibration file                                          <========== SUPER IMPORTANT
**** TODO The CCSDs aren't labelled for some reason.. because of autoaxis??
**** TODO After you add extra files and press process it only shows the new ones
**** TODO Conformation tracking gives weird error

*** Spectral Averaging Gui
**** TODO Clicking 'Open' for amphitrite datafiles doesn't work <===== VERY IMPORTANT
**** TODO In windows it doesn't open text files... No idea why error below <===== VERY IMPORTANT
Says windows in the error, and says there is a missing | in the wildcard string
**** TODO Change color of standard deviation boundaries (reduce the alpha or something)
**** TODO If you opened the text files you shouldn' be able to export an amphi file
Grey it out or give a warning text box

** Issues
*** TODO rename fast_driftscope_image.py to camelCase
*** TODO msClasses
*** TODO imClasses
**** TODO SpecialFigures() is basically not used by anything
+ Got more notes in the actual file

**** TODO ChargeStatePeak() is shit, fix it
+ Only used by Contour Gui, and does a bad job
+ Re-write it from scratch for what you actually want it to do
  + One function is to find the mid points between charge states and use that as limits
    + For edge cases, just calculate for the charge above and below as if it was actually there
  + Second, find it but for all the species in the spectrum
    + Just pass the species, don't let contour gui do any of the work
**** TODO DataSlice.py
+ Need to change how you deal with creating and storing CCSDs
+ getCcsDistribution()
  + returns the y axis for the CCSD
    + Get it to return both axes, the object or rename
  + Used in:
    + IesGui/IesSettings.py
    + imClasses/DataSlice.py
    + imClasses/SpecialFigures.py
+ Start again
  + try to reattach to the functions in the other files
**** TODO TwoDdata()
+ Add set methods for x and y axes
  + Atd() needs to be updated for it
  + CcsD() as well
  + Probably MassSpectrum() too
**** TODO Im()
+ Change how you deal with opening files
  + Ideally make a separate class for it
  + You should be using RawFileProcessor2 not the original
  + Text file input is there so updating that will be useful
    + (for redistribution)
*** TODO gui
**** TODO (Atropos) - Display radiobox needs a popout to pick charge states
**** TODO (Atropos) - Move EditableListCtrl.py up a level
**** TODO (Atropos) - (new version) - just have a button for display theoretical m/z values
+ That then has a selection for
  + Assigning species determined masses
  + Optimised masses
  + Operator defined mass
**** TODO (Atropos) - Make sure pickling the fit is done sensibly 
***** Make sure the ms data isn't stored
**** TODO (IesGui) - MultiDirDialog gives bullshit paths, you haven't fixed the problem
***** Look for "# TODO(gns) - DANGER THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED"
***** Bright light! This is using the old amphitrite format with directories instead of files.
**** TODO (SpectralAveraging) - Same problem with MultiDirDialog
***** Look for "# TODO(gns) - DANGER THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED"
***** Bright light! This is using the old amphitrite format with directories instead of files.
**** TODO (SpectralAveraging) - Change to use amphitrite files
**** TODO (ImProcessorGui) - Make it start making the previews again
*** TODO lib
**** TODO Write a script to process raw files.
Similar to these two files
1) ProcessImRawFiles.py
2) AmphitriteProcessCppAppOutput.py
**** DONE Update draw driftscope script
**** TODO (RawFile..2) improve processFolder() function
+ print cppapplication error to log file
+ Show a warning dialog (at the end?)
+ Stop this stupid waiting running thing
**** TODO (RawFile..2) update the makePreview() function
+ Use the new shiny DriftscopeImage() class
